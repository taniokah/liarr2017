It's my first presentaion in LIARR 2017.

## ABSTRACT

This paper provides detailed suggestions to create an Image Search Engine with Deep Learning.  ere are still few a empts with Deep Learning on a search engine. Here is a good idea of an extremely easy way of building an image search with Elasticsearch and Keras on Jupyter Notebook. So, it is demonstrated how an image search engine can be created where Keras is used to extract features from images, and Elasticsearch is used for indexing and retrieval. To demonstrate how easily this can be achieved, Jupyter notebook is used with two open source libraries, Keras and Elasticsearch.  en, the image search engine can search relevant images by images or keywords. In our approach, keras is regarded as analysis which is a process of converting an image into tokens or terms which are added to the inverted index for searching.

## INSTALLATION

We have to install some libraries: Python, Elasticsearch, Keras, Jupyter Notebook, and TensorFlow. Jupyter Notebook and TensorFlow are optional, because Jupyter Notebook is used for my demonstration and Theano or CNTK is available for Kearas instead of TensorFlow.

My demo environment is MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015). OS X El Capitan (version 10.11), Python 2.7.13 <Anaconda 4.3.1 (x86_64)>, Elasticsearch 5.4.1, Keras 2.0.4, Jupyter Notebook 4.2.1, and TensorFlow 1.1.0 are installed.
